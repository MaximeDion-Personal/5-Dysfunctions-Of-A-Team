# 5-Dysfunctions Of A Team
by Patrick Lencioni

## The 5 Dysfunction

1. **Absence of trust**: unwilling to be vulnerable within the group. Focus on protecting themselves from having their weakness exploited.

2. **Fear of conflict**: seeking artificial harmony over **constructive** passionate debate and keeping other team member accountable for their behavior and to the teams objectives. 

3. **Lack of commitment**: feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization. This happens because people might agree on the surface only so they will drag their feet or act in bad faith expecting failure.

4. **Avoidance of accountability**: ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards
   
5. **Inattention to results**: focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success

## The Cascade
Each of the dysfunction tend to fuel / exacerbate the next one.

1. **Absence of trust** lead to **fear of conflict** because expressing contrary opinions is not safe.
2. **Fear of conflict** lead to **lack of commitment** because people submit instead of agreeing.
3. **Lack of commitment** lead to **avoidance of accountability** since people never really buy into team decisions.
4. **Avoidance of accountability** lead to **inattention to results** because if the individual is not invested in the teams objectives, they will put their own interest instead.

## Trust
In this context trust should not be understood as being predictable or reliable based on past experience, but rather that you believe that your team members intention are good and that there is no reason to be protective or guarded in your interaction with the team. 

It cannot be achieved overnight it require repetition, follow through, credibility and in-depth understanding of team members.

## Politics
When people choose their words and action based on how they want others to react rather than on what they really think.

## Conflict
The reason movies are interesting is that they have conflict that must be overcome that the story make us emotionally invested in. Meeting should already have us invested since they apply to things that directly affect us at work, but tend to be boring because of the lack of challenge. The reason this is a problem, is because people are most likely holding back. By doing so we miss on the opportunity of difference in perspective.

## Consensus 
Is a double edge sword. If everybody agrees on something it can be really good and show great team coordination and alignment. But oftentimes consensus can be faked and people are holding out their disagreement to maintain peace. 

Even in good team people might not end up agreeing but it's important that everyone is heard and that people commit to the team decisions based on trust.  

## Weakness
When there is absence of trust we try to hide mistakes, personal shortcomings, lack of skills and request for help. 

## When interviewing for potential team members
Find someone who can demonstrate trust, engage in conflict, commit to group decisions, hold their peers accountable and focus on the results of the team, not their own ego
Include the whole team.

## Signs of a healthy team
1. Trust each other.
2. Engaged in unfiltered debate around ideas.
3. They commit to clear decisions and plan of actions.
4. Hold each other accountable to deliver on those plan.
5. They focus on the teams achievements more than their own.
